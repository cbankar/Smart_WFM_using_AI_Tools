**Note:**  This is a suggested framework.  The specific number of videos and their duration can be adjusted based on content depth and audience engagement.  Consider incorporating coding examples, demos, and practical exercises within each video to enhance learning.  A strong call to action at the end of each video encouraging viewers to like, subscribe, and leave comments is crucial for YouTube success.  Use clear, concise titles and thumbnails to attract viewers.
