**Note:**  Each playlist would include concise, easily digestible videos (ideally 5-15 minutes each) with clear explanations, code examples, and practical exercises.  Playlists should include coding challenges and quizzes to reinforce learning.  The estimated playlist lengths are approximate and will vary depending on the depth of coverage required.  A strong emphasis on practical examples and hands-on coding would be crucial for effective knowledge transfer.


This structured approach allows for targeted learning, addressing the specific weaknesses identified by the 60/100 C++ networking score.  The YouTube format offers accessibility and flexibility for the candidate.
